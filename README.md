     Submission for Team Abhiyaan
=====================================
Previous Experience

Programmed a comprehensive POS system for grocery stores, that had graphical analysis, Email Billing, and various other nifty features present within it using python. 

It was initially for the 12th project for Python, but I developed it quite comprehensively .

Current PORs:

-Avanti
-iitmTV ACC
-CFI SIP (maybe, awaiting further communication regarding this)
-Avishkar Volunteer (PR& Outerach) (2nd level interview still pending).

Why I want to work in the team:
The team has HUGE potential, as does the industry as a whole. I really think the team is working on cutting edge technologies, and I will get to learn a lot from just contributing to the team. Moreover I am a huge car enthusiast, and am a mega fan of Formula One. So the fact that last year you guys participated in IAC itself is such a cool thing, and so I believe this is a great opportunity for me to learn about autonomous tech, and the amount of work behind it. I also hope and believe I can be a valuable asset to the team, and push it forward in the right direction.
